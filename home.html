        <h2>What is Cappuwiki?</h2>
        <div>
            Cappuwiki is a Wikipedia clone, and a portmanteau of my username (cappucher) and wiki. Anyone can edit, create, and read pages.

            How did I make Cappuwiki?

            Unfortunately, as of March 13, 2023, I do not know how to work with a database. Thus, the technologies that I use include Node.js for the backend, Javascript for the frontend, and a JSON file in order to store all of the pages.
